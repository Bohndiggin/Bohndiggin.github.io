        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>Ever since I can remember, I've been obsessed with computers and tech. Video games have always been a part of my life. I remember playing Red Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge since I was like 11? I relaxed by taking apart old electronics. I spend my lunches watching dry reviews of new technology. (And I love it).</p>
        <br>
        <p>But besides tech, I'm a huge movie buff. Dune is my favorite book, and now, movie. Part one was excellent for many, many reasons. Someday I hope to get into the film industry, but for now, I'm happy tinkering with and using computers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Speaking of tinkering, my new hobby is managing and making a digital collection of films. I decided to go with Plex because it's a bit easier than other options. But combining my love for hardware, software, and video has been very satisfying.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But something that's very important to me is interpersonal relationships. I'm very extroverted, and I love making people laugh.</p>
        <br>
        <p>A final quick thing of note is my love for Factorio. With over 800 hrs you could say I like it a bit. The most satisfying thing about Factorio is the simple, yet complex logistics management. It is always satisfying to get your gear production up by 2%. (Or more)</p>
